# C Practice Problems

This repository contains my solutions to the **Fast Track C Practice Problems** from **Manipal School of Information Sciences (MSIS), MIT**.  
Problems are organized into folders `Day1` through `Day7`, following the official practice problem set.

Development Process

Read the problem statement from the PDF.

Break down each problem into smaller steps (input, processing, output).

Write the logic in a separate function in operations.c.

Declare the function in header.h so it can be used in main.c.  

Call the function from main.c to test it.

Test with sample inputs, making sure the output matches expectations.

Document the code with comments for clarity.

Format the code so itâ€™s easy to read (consistent indentation, naming conventions).

Goal of the Approach

Clarity â†’ Code split into header, main, and logic files.
Scalability â†’ New problems can be added easily without breaking existing code.
Version tracking â†’ GitHub keeps a record of progress and changes.
Professional presentation â†’ README acts as a portfolio document.

## ðŸ›  How to Compile & Run
Open each folder in [Code::Blocks](https://www.codeblocks.org/) **or** compile using GCC or even open in VS code but use gcc to compile:
```bash
gcc main.c operations.c -o program
./program
